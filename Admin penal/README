📌 Project Overview

This project is a full-stack web application developed to provide an online shopping platform where users can browse products, add them to cart, and place orders securely.

The main highlight of this project is the implementation of a secure OTP (One Time Password) based email verification system during user registration.

The application consists of two main modules:

User Module

Admin Module

The project is developed using modern technologies like React.js for frontend and Node.js with Express.js for backend, along with MongoDB as the database.

🎯 Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to:

Develop a real-world E-Commerce platform

Implement secure authentication using OTP verification

Provide role-based access (User & Admin)

Manage products, users, and orders efficiently

Demonstrate full-stack development skills

👤 User Module Description

The User module allows customers to:

Register with email and password

Receive OTP on email

Verify account using OTP

Login securely using JWT authentication

View available products

Add products to cart

Place orders

View order history

The OTP verification ensures that only genuine users can create accounts and access the system.

👨‍💼 Admin Module Description

The Admin module allows the administrator to:

Login securely

Add new products

Update existing products

Delete products

View all registered users

View all orders

Monitor system activities

This module helps in efficient management of the E-Commerce platform.

🔐 OTP Authentication Process

User fills registration form

System generates a random 6-digit OTP

OTP is sent to user’s registered email

User enters OTP on verification page

If OTP matches → Account is verified

After verification → User can login

This process increases security and prevents fake registrations.
